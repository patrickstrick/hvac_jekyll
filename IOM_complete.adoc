:toc: left

== Preface

This booklet is an update and revision of the original Appalachian
Controls Tank Blanketing Installation, Operation & Maintenance
Instructions. Appalachian Controls ceased production of their 78, 79
80 & 90 Series, for which this manual was written, systems in the late ‘90’s.
We here at Appalachian Blanketing Systems are continuing to build
these older style Systems and support them with parts and information.
This booklet is part of that information. It is meant to cover some
basics, installation, operation and maintenance for both the Appalachian
Controls and Appalachian Blanketing Systems tank blanketing systems.

The Appalachian Blanketing Systems series model numbering differs
only from the Appalachian Controls’ numbers in regards to the first two
digits. The 78 Series is now the 121 Series, the 79 Series is now the
046, the 80 Series is now the 461 Series, and the 90 Series is the 243
Series. We will reference both old and new series in this booklet (i.e.,
79/046) as both the old an new models are identical.

We have taken liberty to modify the original text where we needed to
clarify, update and correct information. In some areas of text and
illustration, we have left them completely intact. The person writing
this revision is the same person who wrote it originally in 1990, so
some license will be taken to present a more readable, accurate, and
correct version.

Thank you,

Appalachian Blanketing Systems

== Considerations

The purpose of tank blanketing is to maintain a slightly positive
pressure atmosphere of an inert gas in the vapor space of a vessel, in
relation to external atmospheric pressure. There are three main reasons
why this is desirable for product storage:

. A positive pressure prevents the entrance and migration of ambient
air into the vessel. The ambient air contains oxygen that can react with
the product and moisture that can condense and cause product
contamination and rusting of the interior walls of the tank.
. The exclusion of the oxygen in the air provides safety by reducing
the combustibility of the product and its vapors.
. By maintaining a slightly positive pressure, the possibility of a
vacuum condition that could collapse the tank is greatly minimized.

The blanket pressure is kept to a minimum to conserve the inert gas,
usually nitrogen, which is a purchased product.

. The Appalachian Blanketing Systems are typically set to maintain
a minimum pressure of between 0.5” WC and 1.0” WC
. The Systems normally control within +/- 0.1” WC of set point.
. A blanketing system maintains the lower limit of the vessel’s
internal pressure. The conservation vent limits the upper end of the
vessel’s pressure.
. The wider the difference between the lower and upper settings, the
greater the savings in gas used.
. The blanketing system’s set point should be no higher than 50% of
the conservation vent’s pressure setting. Once opened, a weighted pallet
tank vent can “simmer” until the vessel’s pressure has fallen below 50%
of its opening point.

All gas blanketing systems should be checked periodically to make sure
they are performing to specification.

. Systems are usually located outdoors, on top of the vessels they are
blanketing. Being outdoors they are subject to temperature extremes,
precipitation, sun, ozone, product vapors and wind.
. They must operate for long periods of time with a tight shut off,
but remain sensitive to small pressure changes within the vessel. 3.
They must be able to react with large volumes quickly as transfers or
sudden temperature drops (rain squalls, pump outs, etc.) occur.

Safety considerations:

. Nitrogen, being an inert gas, will _not_ support life when breathed.
It is odorless, colorless and tasteless.
. Vessel pressure ranges must be known and not exceeded. Design
specifications, age, condition of the vessel are all-important
considerations.
. Tank surfaces can be hazardous during inclement weather. Use the
buddy system and safety harnesses.
. Some product vapors are extremely dangerous. Be cautious when
working around a blanketing system or conservation vent. Know your
product and take necessary precautions.

== Gas Blanketing System Installation Instructions

=== General

This System has been assembled, calibrated and tested based on the
pressures indicated on the purchase order (supply pressure and set
point). It is not necessary to make any adjustments to any of the
components, except the Sensing Regulator \(C) for fine tuning of the
blanket set point. Settings of the System’s various regulators are given
on pages 6-7 of this instruction for checking only. Misadjustment of the
regulators can easily render the System inoperative. Refer to *IOM-04*
for precise recalibration instructions.

Please refer to the drawing at the end of this section. The _standard_
components are identified with a letter surrounded by parenthesis ( );
_optional_ components are identified with a letter-number combination
surrounded by brackets [ ] that refer to the _Ordering Information
Table_ of options. The System may incorporate some, all, or none of
these options.

=== Installation

Prior to installation remove all plastic shipping caps (usually 3), give
the System a visual for obvious damage and proceed as follows:

. Piping
.. The sensing line from the Sensing Regulator \(C) to the
tank should be a minimum of 1/2” OD tubing. When running the tubing,
take care to avoid any low spots that could create a “trap”. Slope the
sensing line a minimum of 1/2” per foot of run _towards_ the vessel, so
that the line is self draining into the vessel. If the System does not
have the [C9] Pressure Gauge option, a 1/2” tee with the “branch”
plugged is advisable for checking the System’s set point and future
troubleshooting.
.. The line from the Main Control Valve (A) to the tank should be the
same size, or larger than, the body pipe size of the Main Control Valve.
.. We recommend that the System be mounted on top of the vessel. If the
System is mounted below the top, a “drip leg” should be installed on
both the sensing and main lines at their respective lowest points.
Install a manual valve at these points to periodically remove any
condensate accumulation. *Caution: Condensate may be condensed product
vapors!*
.. Connect the blanketing gas supply to the System’s 1st Stage
Regulator [D], or for Systems without a 1st Stage, directly to the inlet
side of the Main Control Valve (A). Supply pressure should be within +/-
10% of the pressure stated on the purchase order (250 PSIG max. on
Systems with a 1st Stage Regulator).
.. It is recommended that a Y type strainer with a 64 mesh screen be
installed upstream of the System to remove dirt and scale that might
cause internal seating problems.
. Orientation
.. All Systems should be installed in a *horizontal*
pipe run with the regulator diaphragm cases directly above the
centerline of the piping and level.
. Support
.. The average Systems weighs between 25-80 lbs. and is
normally supported by the inlet and outlet piping runs.
. Vessel connections
.. Both the sensing line and main line tank
connections should be made with separate nozzles to avoid any
interaction between each other. If main line flow or pressure is “seen”
by the sensing line, the System may not function properly. Both
connections must be made above the liquid level in the vessel. If the
vessel only has one available connection point, a Single Point Connector
(SPC) is available as an accessory.
. Notes
.. Care has been exercised to keep the System clean and
free from debris. Avoid excessive use of pipe dope. We do not recommend
the use of Teflon tape on pipe joints.
.. When tightening any fitting into the Sensing Regulator \(C) body,
just “snug” tighten. Over tightening will cause the cast iron body to
crack.
.. _Do not weld lines to the System._ The bodies of the three
regulators are either cast iron or ductile iron, which do not lend
themselves well to welding.
.. For future maintenance, pipe unions should be installed on the
inlet, outlet and sensing lines.
.. Shut off valves installed in the inlet, outlet and sensing lines can
be invaluable for servicing and troubleshooting the System. Be sure that
the sensing line valve has a minimum 1/2” port.
.. The sensing line must be free of any restrictions and full diameter
along its full length. Any blockage will cause the System to not
function correctly, or at all.
.. If the System has a Sensing Line Purge option [C6], be sure that the
purge is turned off before closing any isolation valve on the sensing
line. Excessive pressure would build up on the outlet of the Sensing
Regulator \(C) and cause internal damage.

=== Start Up

After all piping is complete, start up the System as follows:

. Open all valves between the System and the tank (main line and
sensing line).
. _Gradually_ open the valve supplying gas to the System. In this way
pressurization is gradual, not abrupt and the System will have time to
reach Pilot Loading pressures. The amount of time will depend on the
size of the vessel, normally just a few seconds. Once the System is
pressurized and the vessel has reached the blanket set point, this valve
should be left wide open.
.. When starting up a single stage System (80/461 or 90/243), throttle
back on the downstream isolation valve about 50% to allow the supply gas
to be diverted up to the Pilot Loading Regulator (B). The flow
capacities on these two single stage Systems is high enough that the
Pilot Loading Regulator may get starved on initial start up.
. In some cases the blanket set point will need some fine tuning. Set
point changes are made at the Sensing Regulator \(C). Remove the spring
adjustment cap (on the spring tower pointing down), turn the spring
adjustment button in, or clockwise as seen from below, to increase the
set point. To decrease the set point, turn the spring button out, or
counterclockwise.
. The 1st Stage Regulator [D], Main Control Valve (A) and Pilot
Loading Regulator (B) are preset and do not require field adjustment. If
it is felt that any of these are out of adjustment, compare the values
found below and call the factory for assistance before resetting. Values
given for the Main Control Valve and Pilot Loading Regulator are as read
on the Pilot Loading Gauge [C5]. The 1st. Stage Regulator setting is as
read on the Interstage Pressure Gauge [D3].

=== Optional Features

Check the System model number, or respective drawing, to determine which
options the System is equipped with. The following is a list of standard
options available and a description of each.

*[C1] Inlet Pressure Gauge* -- Normally mounted at the inlet of the Pilot
Loading Regulator. Indicates inert gas supply pressure to the System.

*[C2] SS Orifice in Sensing Regulator* -- Replaces the standard aluminum
orifice with a 316SS orifice.

*[C3] SS Main Control Valve Orifice* -- Replaces standard brass orifice
with either a 416 SS or 316 SS orifice.

*[C4] SS Tubing Fittings* -- Replaces standard copper and brass tubing
fittings with 316 SS tubing & fittings.

*[C5] Pilot Loading Gauge* -- Indicates pressure downstream of the
Orifice Tee (E) that is controlling the throttling of the Main Control
Valve (A). Primarily used to observe System operation. Standard on all
Systems since 11/91.

*[C6] Sensing Line Purge* -- 0-1 SCFH rotometer used to sweep Sensing
Line towards vessel with the blanket gas to keep detrimental tank vapors
from entering the Sensing Regulator. Fed from downstream tap on Pilot
Loading Regulator. Normally set between ¼ - 1/3 SCFH.

*[C7] Main Line Purge* -- (not shown) has same function as *[C6]* above,
but purges the Main Line from System to vessel.

IMPORTANT: Adjust purge(s) to as low a flow as possible and still
maintain a small positive flow from System to vessel, normally 0.2-0.3
SCFH. *_Do not leave meter valve(s) open at flow rates above 1 SCFH
during normal operation. Also, do not close any valving on the Sensing
Line while the purge is on. Excessive pressure will build up on the
outlet of the Sensing Regulator \(C), causing damage to its valve._*

*[C8] Outlet Check Valve* -- A 316 SS & Teflon spring loaded ball check
valve mounted to the outlet of the System to keep harmful vapors out of
the Main Control Valve (A).

*[C9] Tank Pressure Gauge* -- A low pressure gauge mounted on the outlet
of the Sensing Regulator \(C). Indicates tank pressure as seen by the
Sensing Regulator. Normally supplied with a range from 0” WC through the
vessel’s pressure relief vent setting.

*[C10] Explosion-proof Pressure Switch* -- (Not shown) Contains a set of
SPDT (form C) dry contacts that can be actuated by vessel pressure or
inlet pressure or flow to give a binary output to a remote location.

*[C11] SS Main Control Trim* -- (On Appalachian Blanketing Systems
only) Replaces standard brass internal trim with 416 SS or 316 SS trim.

*[C12e/v] EPDM or Viton Trim, Sensing Regulator* -- Replaces standard
Buna-N diaphragm, valve and seals with EPDM (e) or Viton (v).

*[D1,2] 1st Stage Regulator* -- Reduces the high pressure initial blanket
gas supply pressure to a lower, more controllable level, typically 10
PSIG. This reduced pressure is what the Main Control Valve (A) throttles
into the vessel to maintain the blanket pressure.

*[D3] Interstage Gauge & Shutoff* -- Indicates outlet pressure of 1st
Stage Regulator [D] and pressure being supplied to Main Control Valve
(A). Gauge is 0-30 PSIG range, normally reading 10 PSIG.

*[G] Interstage Safety Relief Valve* -- Provides over-pressure protection
for Main Control Valve (A) in the event of a 1st Stage Regulator failure
and/or limits maximum pressure flowing into vessel in case of Main
Control Valve failing open.

*[Sp] Specials* -- Whenever a System contains a configuration that is not
standard, a “SP” is added to the end of the model number. This “SP” can
refer to any variation from standard from paint to elastomers to piping
arrangements to added components to anything. Refer to the purchase
order specification or the factory to determine what the “SP” stands
for.

== Maintenance Recommendations

. Monthly, or until observation indicates that a more extended period
may be used:
.. Open drain cock on Pilot Loading Regulator (B)
condensate bowl and blow off any accumulated moisture.
.. Visually inspect the System for obvious problems such as external
corrosion, damaged tubing, external leaks, bug vents missing or not
pointing downwards, etc.
.. Cycle the System a few times to check for normal operation.
Manually, slowly relieve internal tank pressure slowly to see if System
maintains vessel pressure at set point.
+
CAUTION: Tank vapors will escape and can be possibly hazardous!
+
.. Observe tank blanket pressure using [C9] Tank Pressure Gauge option
or a manometer. Vessel should be between the System’s set point and the
vessel’s relief vent set point. Above the System’s set point the System
should be shut off and not flowing any gas.
... If tank is above desired set point and flowing, check Pilot Loading
Gauge [C5] pressure reading, sensing line for leaks, or Sensing
Regulator \(C) set point.
... If tank is as at, or just below, set point and flowing, check for
leaks between the outlet of the System and the tank, other tank
connection points and the pressure relief vent.
+
NOTE: Most weighted pallet tank vents do not reseat bubble tight until the vessel pressure has fallen 50% below the vent’s opening set point.
+
... If vessel is below the System’s set point and the System is not
flowing, check the System’s set point setting, that there is gas to the
System, the Pilot Loading pressure ([C5] gauge), blockage between the
Sensing Regulator \(C) and the tank, and any valves between the System
and the tank that might be closed.
. After three months, if moisture has been found in the Pilot Loading
Regulator, blow off condensate monthly and replace internal filter
element as follows:
.. Shut down and depressurize the System by closing inlet gas supply valve and opening vessel relief vent until Pilot Loading Gauge (C5) reads “0”.
... An alternate method is to shut off the supply gas to the System and
open the Sensing Line to atmosphere, which should cause the System to go
wide open and relieve all internal pressures. After the unit is
depressurized, closed the isolation valve between the System and the
tank.
.. Remove Pilot Loading Regulator (B) and disassemble condensate bowl.
.. Clean bowl and install new filter and o-ring.
.. Reassemble, making sure bowl gasket/o-ring is positioned correctly.
.. Remount Pilot Loading Regulator (B) and cycle System several times
to ensure correct operation. If spring set point screw has not been
disturbed, regulator should still have same set point and not need
readjustment.
. Annually:
.. Visually inspect System for external damage/corrosion.
.. Observe all set points to verify they are within specification. The
most critical are the Pilot Loading Pressure and blanket set point
settings.
.. Shut down and depressurize the System
.. Remove 1st Stage Regulator [D] topworks by loosening union nut
between body and diaphragm case and lifting off. Inspect soft seat valve
and orifice for wear/debris. Replace as necessary.
.. Check Main Control Valve (A) valves and orifices,
*** On 79/046 Systems, remove topworks as done on 1st Stage Regulator
[D] above.
*** On 78/121 Systems, remove the four (4) bolts on the bottom plate and
inspect.
*** On 80/461 Systems, unscrew the two (2) side inspection port covers
and inspect.
*** On 90/243 Systems, remove the four (4) cap screws around the Clamp
Ring between the body and diaphragm case and lift off the whole
diaphragm case assembly to inspect. (Note: when reassembling, only
“snug” the four cap screws. Over tightening will crack the Clamp Ring.
.. Remove, inspect, clean and reinstall upstream line strainer.
.. Perform maintenance on Pilot Loading Regulator as detailed in B.2.,
above.
.. Reassemble and pressurize up the System.
.. Use leak detector to check all connections for leaks.
.. Check all set points per Check-out/Recalibration instructions
(IOM-04). Cycle System several times to verify normal operation.
. Whenever replacement parts are needed, it is imperative that the
System’s model number and serial number are provided. Model number &
serial number information located on the name plate riveted to the
System’s angle iron cross bar holding the Sensing \(C) & Pilot Loading
(B) regulators. Over the years some of the components have been revised
and/or modified and there may be problems function and/or fit on
replacement parts.
. We request that whenever problems are encountered in the field with
either an older Appalachian Controls, or our current offering, that you
notify us. We are continually evaluating the Systems and appreciate
comments as to how the Systems are holding up and performing over the
long run.

== System Operation, Check-out and Recalibration

=== Overview
.Applies to both Appalachian Controls & Appalachian Blanketing Systems systems
. To give a description of how the Systems operate.
. To give an in-depth field set up for testing and recalibration of a System while installed on a vessel.
. To give a field guide for checking & recalibrating Systems while on the tank.

=== System Operation
.The following will give a detailed description of how a System works.
. Supply gas enters the inlet of the 1st Stage Regulator [D] or inlet
of Main Control Valve (A) if no 1st Stage Regulator.
. On two stage Systems, the majority of the gas is reduced to,
typically, 10 PSIG and sent down the Interstage Piping (L) to the Main
Control Valve (A).
. A tap on the inlet side of the 1st Stage Regulator [D], or inlet
side of the Main Control Valve (A) on single stage Systems, feeds a
portion of the supply gas up to the Pilot Loading Regulator (B) via the
Pilot Regulator Supply Tube (N).
. The Pilot Loading Regulator (B) reduces the inlet pressure to pilot
loading pressure for the particular System.
** 78 Series (w/Rockwell 122 Reg.)
*** Static set is 28” WC/16 oz/1 PSIG
** 79/046 & 80/461 Series
*** Static set is 10 PSIG
** 90/243 & 78/121 (w/121 Reg.) Series
*** Static set is 3 PSIG
. Reduced pressure pilot loading gas passes through the Orifice Tee (E) (1/4” street tee) on the outlet of the Pilot Loading Regulator (B)
.. Orifice Tee (E) is 0.06”-0.07” diameter.
.. If System has purge option(s) (C6/C7), the flow meter is fed from
the downstream side tap on the Pilot Loading Regulator, flows through
the flow meter and is tapped into the outlet of the Sensing Regulator’s \(C) body.
+
NOTE: From this point on, all Pilot Loading pressures can be monitored on the
[C5] Pilot Loading Gauge.
+
. On initial startup all regulators are normally open, so there is
immediately a flow into the vessel. As the vessel’s pressure comes up,
tank pressure increases, causing the Sensing Regulator to close off
against its seat/orifice. ([C5] Gauge starts at “0” and rises as Main
Control Valve (A) closes off.)
. With the Sensing Regulator closed, pressure fills the Pilot Loading
Tubing (F), backside/underside of the Main Control Valve (A) diaphragm
case and to the inlet side of the Sensing Regulator \(C).
. As the pressure builds in the Main Control Valve’s diaphragm case
(Sensing Regulator \(C) closed), the diaphragm moves, against a spring on
the opposite side of the diaphragm, to close off the Main Control
Valve’s seat/valve. These pressures can be read on the [C5] Gauge.
** 78 Series (w/Rockwell 122 Reg.)
*** Start-to-close = 7-8 oz./in^2^
*** Full close by 12 oz./in^2^
** 79/046 & 80/461 Series
*** Start-to-close = 5-6 PSIG
*** Full close by 8-9 PSIG
** 90/243 & 78/121 (w/121 Reg.) Series
*** Start-to-close = 2-2.25 PSIG
*** Full close by 2.75 PSIG
. When tank pressure falls to, or below, the Sensing Regulator’s \(C) set point,
.. Tank pressure loading the upper side of the Sensing Regulator \(C)
diaphragm decreases,
.. The set point spring on the atmospheric side of the diaphragm moves
the diaphragm, moving the Sensing Regulator’s valve off its seat
(orifice). [C5] Gauge starts to drop.
.. Because the Sensing Regulator’s orifice is larger than the orifice
in the Orifice Tee (E), the pressure in the Pilot Loading Tubing (F)
drops, decreasing the pressure in the Main Control Valve’s diaphragm
case.
.. As pressure decreases in the Main Control Valve’s diaphragm case,
its set point spring moves the diaphragm, lifting the Main Control’s
valve off its seat (orifice).
.. This allows the blanket gas to flow into the tank, maintaining the
tank’s minimum pressure setting.
. When the tank pressure rises above the Sensing Regulator’s \(C) set point ([C5] gauge rises),
.. Tank pressure loads the Sensing Regulator’s diaphragm, causing it to move, closing the Sensing Regulator’s valve and orifice. [C5] Gauge rises.
.. With the Sensing Regulator’s valve closed, gas fed through the
Orifice Tee (E) now builds pressure in the Pilot Loading Tubing (F) and
the Main Control Valve’s diaphragm case, closing off flow to the tank.

. Because we are using variable pressure signals based on vessel
pressure, the System’s response is proportional, or throttling, to match
the rate of leakage, pump out, or contraction within the vessel. The
[C5] Pilot Loading Gauge is an invaluable and excellent tool to watch a
System operating and troubleshooting problems.

=== Set Up for Testing/Troubleshooting

. Verify actual supply pressure at inlet of System. If a tap or gauge is not installed near the System’s inlet and the System does not have the Inlet Pressure Gauge option [C1], install a gauge as follows:
.. Shut off supply gas to System and depressurize System (see IOM-03,
B.1.).
.. Cut Pilot Loading Regulator Supply Tubing (N) and install a
compression x female fitting in the line. Fitting should be 3/8”OD x
3/8”OD x 1/4” FNPT.
.. Install a pressure gauge with a range that is twice the normal
supply pressure to the newly installed tee’s 1/4” branch port.
.. An alternative would be to remove the 3/8”OD x 1/4” MNPT compression
fitting from the inlet side of the Pilot Loading Regulator (B), install
a 1/4” street tee in it’s place with a new 3/8” OD x 1/4” MNPT
compression fitting, shorten the Pilot Regulator Supply Tubing (N) and
reconnect to new fitting. The pressure gauge can now installed into the
open 1/4” FNPT port of the street tee.
. Verify the Pilot Loading Regulator’s (B) set point is set to spec.
This is read on the Pilot Loading Pressure Gauge (C5), which has been
standard on all Systems for a number of years. If the System does not have one, install one in the branch port (should have a
plug) of the Orifice Tee (E). Static setting is highest reading on C5
gauge, Sensing Regulator \(C) outlet blocked off or tank pressure well
above System set point.
** Older 78 Series (w/122 Regulator) Systems
*** Use 0-32 oz./0-55” WC range gauge
** 79/046 & 80/461 Series
*** Use 0-30 PSIG range gauge
** 90/243 & 78/121 Series (w/121 Regulator) Systems
*** Use 0-5 PSIG range gauge
** Static settings should read:
*** Older 78 Series (w/122 Regulator)
**** 16 oz/in^2^ or 1 PSIG
*** Newer 78/121 (w/121 Regulator) & 90/243 Systems
**** 3.5-4.0 PSIG
*** 79/046 & 80/461 Systems
**** 10 PSIG
. Verify actual tank pressure, preferably at the Sensing Regulator \(C)
outlet port.
.. If the tank does not have a pressure gauge and the [C9]
option has not been ordered with the System, install a Dwyer Magnehelic
pressure gauge or manometer with a range not exceeding three (3) times
the desired set point.
... Cut Sensing Line and insert a 1/2” tee in the line. Use the “run” of
the tee to continue the Sensing Line, use the “branch” as the gauge
port.
... Either permanently mount a gauge to the tee, or temporally run a
tube from the tee to the gauge or manometer.
.. Pressure read at this point is the tank pressure as seen by the
System’s Sensing Regulator \(C).
. If System is a two stage System, the interstage pressure between the
1st Stage Regulator [D] and the Main Control Valve (A) is typically 10
PSIG and is read on the Interstage Pressure Gauge [D3]. If the System
does not have this gauge, remove the 1/4” pipe plug in the middle of the
Interstage Piping and install a 0-30 PSI gauge.

We are now ready to monitor all pressures involved with troubleshooting
and/or recalibrating a System.

=== Recalibration

[IMPORTANT]
====
The very first step in recalibrating either an Appalachian
Controls or Appalachian Blanketing Systems System is to NOT change any
of the settings.

. All regulators are preset after assembly to the specifications given
on the purchase order, approximating those conditions as closely as
possible.
. There is only a 10% chance that if you are experiencing problems
with a System that any of the settings need to be adjusted.
. There is a less than 1% chance that the 1st Stage Regulator [D] or
main Control Valve (A) is out of adjustment.
====

.The following are the steps that should be followed in checking out a System.
. Verify that the inlet (supply) pressure is at normal
operating pressure and the same as specified on the original purchase
order.
.. This is particularly critical on the older style Appalachian
Controls 78 Series Systems that used a Rockwell 122 Main Control Valve
(A) with a 1 PSIG Pilot Loading pressure. A 50 PSIG _increase_ of the
inlet/supply pressure caused an approximate 1 PSIG decrease in the Pilot
Loading Regulator’s outlet setting.
.. Close the isolation valve on the downstream side of the System
between the System and the tank.
.. If the System does not have the Inlet Pressure Gauge option [C1],
install one as detailed above in paragraph A. In the *Set Up for
Testing* instructions .
.. Read the static supply pressure. Reading should be within 10% of
what originally stated when the System was ordered.
. Verify that the 1st Stage Regulator [D] (if so equipped) is reducing
the inlet/supply pressure to, typically, 10 PSIG by reading the
Interstage Pressure Gauge [D3], or a gauge as installed in paragraph D.
above under *Set Up for Testing* instructions**.**
.. Exception: Some 79/046 or 90/243 Systems used higher or lower
Interstage Pressure settings to get higher or lower flows through the
Main Control Valve (A). Usually in increments of 5 PSIG. Check with
factory if you have a question.
.. Set point adjustment of the 1st Stage Regulator is done by loosening
the lock nut on the end of the regulator and screwing the screw in to
increase the set point, or out to decrease the set point. Retighten lock
nut after making adjustment(s).
.. Static set point should be no lower than 10 PSIG (typically), and
can be a little higher (2-3 PSIG), without harm.
. Verify Pilot Loading Regulator (B) static setting by reading [C5]
Pilot Loading Pressure Gauge or gauge installed in paragraph B. in *Set
Up for Testing* section. This gauge became a standard on all Systems
built after 11/91.
.. To read the static setting, the Sensing Line should be blocked off,
the Sensing Line Purge option [C6] turned off and normal operating
supply pressure to the System.
+
NOTE: Variations in supply pressure will inversely affect the Pilot

.. Adjustment is accomplished by removing the closing cap on the top of
the regulator, loosening the adjustment screw lock nut and screwing the
screw in to increase the setting, or back the screw out to decrease the
setting. Retighten lock nut and replace closing cap when done.
. Main Control Valve (A) - This is used as a pressure operated control
valve and is preset to close at a predetermined setting. *DO NOT TOUCH
ITS SETTINGS AT THIS TIME!* The chances that this regulator is out of
adjustment is 1 in 100. Let’s keep this check out as simple as possible.
.. Pressures as read on Pilot Loading Pressure Gauge [C5] while Pilot
Loading pressures are modulating:
*** Older 78 Series (w/Rockwell 122 Main)
**** Start-to-close: 8 oz.
**** Full close: 12 oz.
*** Newer 78/121 (w/Rockwell 121 Main) & 90/243 Series
**** Start-to-close: 2.25 PSIG
**** Full close: 2.75 PSIG
*** 79/046 & 80/461 Series
**** Start-to-close: 5-6 PSIG
**** Full close: 7-9 PSIG
.. The Main Control Valve setting does not have to be exact, the System
will self compensate for this setting. The most critical part of the
setting is to make sure that the Main Control Valve is completely closed
off _just before_ reaching the Pilot Loading Regulator’s static setting.
This allows a little over pressure to ensure a good tight close off.
. Sensing Regulator \(C) - Verify tank blanket pressure set point
setting by reading accurate tank pressure gauge (option [C9]) or
manometer as set up in paragraph C. above in *Set for Testing* section.
.. All line valves to inlet of System, from System to tank, and on the
Sensing Line to the tank must be wide open.
.. If the System is equipped with the Sensing Line Purge Option [C6],
close the purge meter’s valve to avoid any influence.
.. Adjust the blanket set point by removing the cap that is on the
spring tower (pointing down). Inside is a plastic adjustment button.
This button has a 7/16” hex slot in the center and two indents on either
side for a flat bladed screwdriver.
.. Screw the adjustment button in, or “up” to increase the setting, or
out, “down”, to decrease the setting.
.. When changing this set point, the actual tank pressure will need to
be bled off to allow the System to cycle a few times. The System will
bring the tank to the new setting and close off. This is especially true
if you are decreasing the Sensing Regulator’s set point.
.. Replace Cap, set purge to around 0.2 SCFH. If turning the purge on
changes the sensed pressure pressure read, there is some restriction in
the line between the Sensing Regulator and the tank.
.. System is back in service.
